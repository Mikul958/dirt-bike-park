A basic dirt bike park API that allows users to create dirt bike park entries and create bookings for those parks. Carts and created and referenced with a session ID, and carts store any bookings added until those bookings are either removed or finalized. Bookings can be finalized through a payment request, where a successful payment removes all paid for bookings from the cart and assigns them to a park permanently until they are removed.

This project was created as a final project for CSCE 547 (Windows Programming) as an introduction to the C# programming language, .NET framework, and Entity Framework Core ORM.
